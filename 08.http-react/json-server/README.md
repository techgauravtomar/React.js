# Create Your Local JSON Server

**JSON Server is a lightweight server that allows you to quickly create a REST API with a JSON file as a data source. It's useful for prototyping and front-end development, as it allows you to quickly create a fake API to work with before the real one is ready.**

**With JSON Server, you can create a server that serves static JSON data by creating a JSON file that contains your data and running the server with the json-server command. JSON Server will automatically create a REST API based on the data in your JSON file, with support for pagination, filtering, sorting, and more.**

## How To Setup JSON Server

### 1. create a json file to store tha data

### 2. create a package

### 3. install the json-server package

### 4. add code to package

```
 "serve-json": "json-server --watch db.json"
 "serve-json": "json-server --watch db.json --port 4000 "
 
```

### 5. run the server

```
npm run serve-json
```

## Filter The Data


## Route of the data
```
module.exports = () => {
  const data = { products: [] }
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    data.products.push({ id: i, title: `product${i}` })
  }
  return data
}
```
